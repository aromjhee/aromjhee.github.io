									<h2>Here's my story...</h2>
									<p>“What are you doing working in a restaurant?“</p>
								</header>
								<p>
                  This is the question I would often hear from peers and families, and sometimes even from my loyal customers. I achieved
                  my life-long goal of becoming a restaurant owner through determination and many self-sacrifices. But when that failed, I
                  thought maybe there is some truth to what people see in me and that there is a career more fitting.

										<h3>How I got into software development</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    I can not describe how I felt when I discovered programming, because I found all that I loved about the food business in
                    the coding world as well. For example, being able to see and feel the overall “flow” of what I’m operating. As a manager
                    of the restaurant, I knew exactly what was going on inside the kitchen even while I was by the entrance greeting
                    customers. It was an important skill because it enabled me to find bottlenecks and make improvements to restaurant’s
                    operations. Now as a software engineer, I can see the data queried from the database is being sent to the front-end, in
                    what structure, by which route, going through which functions, hitting which if-statements, etc. By grasping that
                    bird’s-eye view, I can make my code more efficient, more readable, and optimized.

										<h3>My experience in the coding boot camp</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    My experience at App Academy, a prestigious bootcamp, has given me ample amount of experience in JavaScript,
                    Python, React, Docker, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express. My proudest feature in my <a href="https://hidden-fortress-08833.herokuapp.com/">C.A.R.L</a> and <a href="https://e-commerce-5555-frontend.herokuapp.com/">imma-Zone</a> are the unit tests. With patience and some time, I’m able to debug faster and
                    ensure my code’s integrity simultaneously. There is nothing like knowing what I have set to do is foolproof and all it
                    required was discipline. Which is another part I love about coding. Writing code follows strict rules and syntax, that must be learned, understood, and followed. There are many schools of thought on coding practices,
                    like TDD, that resonate with my core.

										<h3>What I bring to the table</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    I can come hit the ground running. I can learn a new technology quickly and apply them swiftly. I’m not afraid to dig
                    through documentation myself, but also know when to ask. My team can rely on me to carry my weight. My team will know I
                    never fail to deliver. I’m that teammate who wants to create powerful synergy to not just accomplish amazing results,
                    but to do them in a stunning fashion. I want to have my team end a sprint cycle with high-fives and fist-bumps..

                    Thank you for reading and please feel free to
