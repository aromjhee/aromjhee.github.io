                  This is the question I would often hear from peers and families, and sometimes even from my loyal customers. I achieved
                  my life-long goal of becoming a restaurant owner through determination and many self-sacrifices. But when that failed, I
                  thought maybe there is some truth to what people see in me and that there is a career more fitting.

										<h3>How I got into software development</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    I felt at home when I discovered programming, because I found all that I loved about the food business in the coding
                    world as well. For example, <em>feeling</em> the “flow” of the operation. I knew exactly what was going on inside the kitchen even while I was by the entrance greeting
                    customers. I'm able to do this as well as a software engineer where queried data are sent, in some data structure,
                    through some functions, and rendered on a specific location on the browser. This skill enables me to find bottlenecks
                    and make improvements, which can be so satisfying. Additionally, by grasping that bird’s-eye view, I can make my code
                    more efficient, more readable, and optimized.

										<h3>My experience in the coding boot camp</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    I have ample amount of experience in JavaScript, Python, React, Docker, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express,
                    HTML, CSS. My proudest achievement is the unit tests I wrote for my project <a href="https://hidden-fortress-08833.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C.A.R.L</a> and <a href="https://e-commerce-5555-frontend.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imma-Zone</a>. I’m able to debug faster and ensure code integrity with test driven development and all it requires is discipline. TDD
                    resonates with my core in that I should be disciplined and write sustainable, error-proven code.

										<h3>What I bring to the table</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    As a former restaurant owner, I have a deep understanding of what it means to work in a fast paced environment. I'm
                    flexible and responsive to requirement changes, attuned with customer needs, and able to interconnect every aspect of a
                    product to a business idea. As a software developer, I’m not afraid to dig through the documentation and ask questions.
                    My team can rely on me to carry my weight and always deliver. I want to be part of a team to create a synergy
                    to end a sprint cycle with high-fives and fist-bumps.
