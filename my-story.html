                  This is a question I would often get from my peers and families, and sometimes from the customers. I finally became a
                  restaurant owner but, when my restaurant failed, I thought maybe there is some truth to what people see in me and that
                  there is a career more fitting for me -- software engineering.

										<h3>How I got into software development</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    I remembered a time as a child wondering how Gameboys worked. All I saw were shiny things on a green plastic board. I
                    did not bother asking my parents because I knew I could not possibly understand. Then, the internet and Star Craft
                    happened. I was even more confused. Now, I do not need to be as I can start this journey to learn.

										<h3>My experience in the coding boot camp</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                    I have learned to build full stack applications using JavaScript, React and Python with SQL and noSQL databases like
                    PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firebase. My proudest achievement is writing over 100 unit tests for my project <a href="https://hidden-fortress-08833.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C.A.R.L</a> and <a href="https://e-commerce-5555-frontend.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imma-Zone</a>. I learned, with little discipline and planning, I’m able to debug faster and ensure code integrity with test driven
                    development. TDD resonates with my values in being disciplined and planning to minimize future errors.

                    As a person who has experience building a business from the ground up, I'm confident I have what it takes to become an
                    engineer. I'm flexible and responsive to requirement changes, attuned with customer needs, and able to interconnect a
                    business idea to every aspect of a product. I have a deep understanding of what it means to work in a fast paced
                    environment. My team can rely on me to carry my weight and consistently deliver. I'm a person who brings the energy to
                    end sprint cycles with high-fives and fist-bumps.
